## Recent Changes (Aug 28, 2025)

- âœ… **CRITICAL PRODUCTION BUG FIXED** - Resolved booking creation failure in production
  - **Issue**: Booking route wasn't generating UUIDs, causing "undefined" IDs and database constraint violations
  - **Fix**: Added `crypto.randomUUID()` ID generation to booking creation route
  - **Database Cleanup**: Removed corrupted booking record with undefined ID from production
  - **Verification**: New bookings now create successfully with proper UUIDs
- âœ… **Comment Focus Issue Resolved** - Fixed textarea losing focus while typing
  - **Solution**: Added `spellCheck={false}` and `autoComplete="off"` to prevent browser interference
  - **UI Preserved**: Maintained exact approved Comments interface design
- âœ… **Production Deployment Ready** - All fixes tested and validated in development

## Previous Changes (Aug 27, 2025)

- âœ… **TRUE DATABASE SEPARATION ACHIEVED** - Implemented schema-based separation within single PostgreSQL instance
  - **Production Schema**: Contains all real data (10 members, 26 bookings through Aug 27, 32 activities)
  - **Development Schema**: Contains clean sample data (5 dev members, 3 sample bookings)
  - **Environment Detection**: Automatically switches schemas based on NODE_ENV and REPLIT_DEPLOYMENT
  - **Data Safety**: Production data fully preserved and isolated from development work
- âœ… **Critical Data Placement Corrected** - Fixed initial misplacement where production data was in wrong schema
  - **Issue Identified**: Production data was accidentally moved to development schema
  - **Resolution**: Moved real production data back to production schema via automated script
  - **Verification**: Confirmed latest bookings through August 27th in correct production location
- âœ… **Dynamic Schema Detection** - Improved environment-aware database connection
  - **Development Mode**: Uses development.* tables with sample data for safe testing
  - **Production Mode**: Uses production.* tables with authentic booking history
  - **Runtime Switching**: Schema selection happens at query time, not initialization
- âœ… **Comment Focus Issue Fixed** - Simplified component structure to prevent input focus loss during typing
- âœ… **Previous Features Maintained**:
  - **Comments Feature** with CRUD operations and multiple display variants
  - **Time-Based Booking Restrictions** (past days + today after 9:30 AM disabled)
  - **Sortable Monthly Participation** tracking with visual indicators

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript and Vite for development tooling
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing (lightweight alternative to React Router)
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management and caching
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library with Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom Ramp-inspired design tokens
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation for type-safe form handling
- **Date Handling**: date-fns library for date manipulation and formatting

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript for the REST API server
- **Development**: TSX for running TypeScript files directly in development
- **Build System**: ESBuild for production bundling with Node.js compatibility
- **API Structure**: RESTful endpoints under `/api` prefix for members, bookings, and activities
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error middleware with structured error responses

### Data Storage
- **Primary Storage**: PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM and schema-based separation
- **Database Architecture**: Single PostgreSQL instance with two schemas:
  - **production.*** tables: Real production data (10 members, 26 bookings, 32 activities)
  - **development.*** tables: Sample data for safe development testing (5 dev members, 3 sample bookings)
- **Environment-Aware Data Management**: 
  - **Development**: Automatically uses development schema with clean sample data
  - **Production**: Automatically uses production schema with authentic booking history
  - **Schema Switching**: Dynamic based on NODE_ENV and REPLIT_DEPLOYMENT environment variables
- **Data Safety**: Complete isolation between environments while sharing single database instance
- **Migration Path**: All production data successfully recovered and placed in correct schema
- **Backup Strategy**: ReplDB contains historical backup of original production data

### Design System
- **Theme**: Ramp-inspired color palette with custom CSS variables
- **Components**: shadcn/ui "new-york" variant with neutral base colors
- **Typography**: Inter font family for clean, modern appearance
- **Dark Mode**: CSS class-based dark mode support (configured but not actively used)
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first responsive design with Tailwind breakpoints

### Development Workflow
- **Hot Reload**: Vite HMR for instant development feedback
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript configuration across client and server
- **Code Organization**: Monorepo structure with shared types and utilities
- **Build Process**: Separate client and server build pipelines with optimized output

## External Dependencies

### Core Libraries
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: PostgreSQL database driver (for future database migration)
- **drizzle-orm**: Type-safe ORM with schema validation
- **drizzle-zod**: Integration between Drizzle and Zod for runtime validation

### Frontend Dependencies
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management and caching
- **@radix-ui**: Comprehensive set of accessible UI primitives
- **wouter**: Lightweight React router
- **date-fns**: Date manipulation and formatting utilities
- **class-variance-authority**: Utility for creating component variants
- **clsx** and **tailwind-merge**: Utility libraries for conditional CSS classes

### Development Tools
- **vite**: Fast build tool and development server
- **tsx**: TypeScript execution for Node.js
- **esbuild**: Fast JavaScript bundler for production builds
- **@replit/vite-plugin-runtime-error-modal**: Development error handling
- **@replit/vite-plugin-cartographer**: Replit-specific development features

### UI and Styling
- **tailwindcss**: Utility-first CSS framework

- **autoprefixer**: CSS vendor prefix automation

The application is designed to be easily deployable on Replit with built-in development tools and can be migrated from file-based storage to PostgreSQL without changing the application logic due to the abstracted storage layer.
